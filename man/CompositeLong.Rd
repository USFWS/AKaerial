\description{
CompositeLong compiles appropriate estimates from multiple surveys for Taverner's geese, Pacific whitefronts, mid-continent whitefronts, western tundra and Pacific coast trumpeter swans, and lesser Canada geese.

\details{
USFWS-MBM-Alaska Region surveys are used in harvest management decisions by the Pacific Flyway.  Although management plans generally use a single survey index to decide
appropriate management actions, 6 species require a composite index across 2 or more Alaska Region surveys.  These species and their composite indices are: \enumerate{
\item Taverner's geese (TAVS) - All strata from the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACPHistoric), CCGO in the "low" stratum or at latitudes > 63 on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKGHistoric), strata 10, 11, and 99 (clipped section of 9) on the WBPHS (WBPHSHistoric)
\item Pacific white-fronted geese - GWFG on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKGHistoric) or in strata 8 or 99 on the WBPHS (WBPHSHistoric)
\item Western tundra swans (TUSW) - TUSW or SWAN on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKGHistoric) or in strata 8, 99, 10, or 11 on the WBPHS (WBPHSHistoric)
\item Lesser Canada geese - CCGO in strata 1, 2, 3, 4, or 12 on the WBPHS (WBPHSHistoric)
\item Mid-continent white-fronted geese - GWFG in strata 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, or 11 on the WBPHS (WBPHSHistoric) and all GWFG on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACPHistoric)
\item Pacific coast trumpeter swans (TRSW) - TRSW or SWAN in strata 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 on the WBPHS (WBPHSHistoric)
}
Note that WBPHS stratum 9 is clipped and renamed 99 to avoid double counting birds in an area surveyed on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta surveys.
The default range of years for each species is set to the earliest year in which all surveys that make up the index were conducted.
